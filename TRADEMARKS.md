# Trademark and Brand Usage Policy 

Welcome to the Research Space Trademark and Brand Usage Policy. This policy is designed to answer the most frequent questions we receive regarding use of our trademarks, to provide our community with clear guidance, and to enable you to make certain uses of our trademarks without the need to seek our individual, written permission in each instance.  

## What are Trademarks? 

Trademarks are best thought of as a type of consumer protection law: they help those seeking goods and services efficiently differentiate one supplier from another. The term “trademark” includes any word, name, symbol, or device – or any combination of those – that is used by a person or entity to identify and distinguish their goods and services from those offered by others, and to indicate the source or origin of their goods and services.  

## What are Research Space Trademarks? 

The Research Space trademarks are all trademarks owned or used by Research Space, including but not limited to: 

- RSpace Enterprise logo 
- RSpace Community logo 
- Research Space  
- RSpace 

This list may be updated as other trademarks are created or registered.

## In Which Situations May I Use the Research Space Trademarks? - To Truthfully Identify Research Space and Our Products and Services  

Your intended use may be a nominative fair use if: 

- it’s not easy to identify the product or company without using a mark.  
- only so much is used as is necessary to identify the product or company and to accomplish your purpose and you do nothing to suggest the mark-owner has endorsed or sponsored your use. 
- you use the trademarks for Personal, Non-Commercial purposes. 

## In Which Situations May I NOT Use the Research Space? 

In any situation not specifically listed above, and where you are not otherwise legally permitted to do so, you must ask us for permission before using our trademarks. For example, you may not use our trademarks in the following situations:  

## Uses that are Confusing, False, or Misleading 

You may not use any Research Space trademark in a manner that is false or misleading, or in a manner likely to confuse consumers or the public about the source or origin of your products or services. Confusing uses include uses that may cause people to think your products or services are Research Space’s products or services, or vice versa, or that may imply a formal affiliation between you and Research Space where none exists. Unless we have done so in writing, Research Space has not officially sponsored or endorsed your product or service, and you should not imply that we have. 

  

You may not use the Research Space trademarks in, or as a part of, any trade name, trademark, domain name, or internet account name that is likely to cause confusion.  

That said, the purpose of trademark law is to address confusion, and uses that misleadingly suggest affiliation where none exists. 

## Uses of Research Space Trademarks in Connection with Derivative Software 

Research Space offers some software products to the community on a free and open source basis (our “Open Source Products”), which means that you can alter and modify the source code to better suit your needs. From a trademark point of view, software that you have modified is different from the software that originates from Research Space, and you may not brand any derivative software with a Research Space Trademark, even if you make only minor changes to it, except as provided below (repackaging).  

You can, however, use the Research Space Tradmarks to truthfully describe your own products or services in a descriptive, non-trademark sense. However, using Research Space’s logos or designs, or otherwise making a trademark-type use of the Research Space Trademarks would not be permitted. 

If you produce a plugin that is compatible with one of our Open Source Products, you may use the Open Source Product’s trademark as part of the filename for your plugin, though we ask that you also include your own name in the filename, to avoid confusion with official Research Space plugins. We also ask that you provide appropriate attribution to Research Space as the source of the original Open Source Product in any NOTICE, README, LICENSE, or similar file in your distribution, and as appropriate elsewhere in your source code.  

## Uses of Research Space Trademarks in Connection with New Software Packages 

“Packaging” software, or creating a new software package, refers to the process of modifying the original source code of software solely for the purpose of enabling that software to function in a different operating system environment (e.g., modifying its libraries, dependencies, etc.), made without modifying the functionality and/or objectives of the original software product. As noted above, you are not permitted to use our Research Space Trademarks in connection with software derived from our Open Source Products. But, if you are only creating a new package of an Open Source Product, we grant you permission to use the Trademarks, provided that you do each of the following: 

You may use the mark only when packaging the particular Open Source Product it refers to.  

You may only use the word mark (e.g., RSpace) and not any design marks, logos, or the like, that may be associated with the Open Source Product you are packaging.  

You may use the mark only in connection with packaging an Open Source Product for use with the particular operating system specified in your request (as explained below), and only where you are making no significant or functional change to the software.  

Any package you create using a Research Space Mark must be of high quality, and must meet any standards of quality that we establish, and as we may change from time to time. We reserve the right to request changes if your software deviates from our quality standards, and your continued use of all Research Space trademark is expressly conditioned on your prompt implementation of such changes. 

Research Space has the right to audit any software whose trademark you use pursuant to the permission granted in this section. Upon Research Spaces' request you must provide us with a link to the project source code e.g., at GitHub, and/or any advertising associated with the product, so that we can audit it periodically to ensure its quality, compatibility with the upstream version, etc. If you decide to cease active development of your package, you agree to let us know about that too. Please update us on the status of your package and tell us if the person maintaining the project changes. 

Consistent with the other elements of this policy, please do not do anything to imply a greater level of sponsorship by or affiliation with Research Space than actually exists. 

Before using any Research Space trademark in connection with any package, we ask that you please first contact Research Space at support[@]researchspace.com to provide (1) the name of the software you are packaging, and the operating system(s) you are packaging it for; (2) your contact information; (3) a link to your project’s source code and, if you have one, project website; and (4) a description of how you intend to use the Research Space trademarks in connection with your package. This is requested, but not required if you are simply using the Research Space software as is, or if you are using your own name for your software project, and only using the Research Space trademark to truthfully describe your own products or services in a descriptive, non-trademark sense (i.e. statements like “based on RSpace” or “forked from RSpace”).  Even when we require advance notice, you need not wait for a response from us before starting to use the Research Space trademark in connection with your project, but as noted above we reserve the right to control the quality of projects that use a Research Space trademark, so we may follow up with specific requests. To be clear, this policy is simply about ensuring that software named with a Research Space trademark meets high quality standards, it does not require you to do anything to take advantage of our open software licenses under your own branding.  

## What If I Want Permission For a Use Not Allowed By This Policy? 

If you wish to use any of the Research Space trademarks in a manner that is not expressly permitted by this policy, or otherwise permitted by a trademark law exception such as fair use, please contact us directly at support[@]researchspace.com. We will be happy to consider your request. For most efficient processing of your request, your email should: 

provide plenty of detail regarding the requested use; contain a mockup of the use you plan to make, so that we can review it ; be clear as to timing and when you require approval; and let us know whether the goods you plan to produce will be given away for free, or how you anticipate pricing them, if applicable. We ask that you submit any such requests to us at least four (4) weeks before you require approval.  

## If I Have Permission to Use a Research Space trademark, What Are the Usage Restrictions for That Trademark? 

Use the Exact Mark. Research Space’s trademarks should be used in their exact, most up-to-date form. They should neither be abbreviated nor combined with other words. 

Mark the Mark. The first or most prominent use of a Research Space trademark should be accompanied by a “tm” symbol (“™”), to indicate that it is a trademark; you may also use the “r in a circle” symbol (“®”) if the trademark in question is a registered trademark. If you are not sure, using the “tm” symbol (“™”) is fine. The first or most prominent mention of a Research Space trademark should also be set apart from surrounding text, either by capitalizing, italicizing, bolding, or underlining it. 

  

Credit the Mark. The following notice text should appear somewhere near your first or most prominent mention of a Research Space trademark (for example in a footer). If that is not practical, you may include it in a reasonable alternate location:  

        [mark] is a trademark of Research Space. 

Any goodwill generated by use of the Research Space trademarks shall inure solely to the benefit of Research Space. 

  

## How Do I Report Trademark Abuse? 

Please report any misuse of the Research Space trademarks to support[@]researchspace.com, and provide us with as much information as you can about the use you think might be infringing. We will investigate the use, and take appropriate action, if warranted.
